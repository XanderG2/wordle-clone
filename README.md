# Wordle

Wordle built using Python for the console.

This uses a very long list of words that I got from [dwyl/english-words/words_alpha.txt](https://github.com/dwyl/english-words)
This uses regular wordle rules, with the ability to select length of word.
Includes a version for background colouring (using ANSI escape codes), and a version with emojis (for consoles that can't render background colours).
Built using PyInstaller.
